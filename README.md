# CS300-Portfolio
Porfolio Submission for CS300 - Data Structures and Algorithms

**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**  
In Project One, I analyzed the run-time and memory of different data structures. In Project Two, I built a program that could load, sort, and display a list of Computer Science courses in alphanumeric order.

**How did you approach the problem?**  
I focused on understanding the performance trade-offs between data structures. For Project Two, I used a Binary Search Tree to efficiently store and sort the course data automatically.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**  
I had issues getting my program to properly locate and load the input file. I fixed this by troubleshooting file paths, adjusting Visual Studio project settings, and using a direct file path temporarily to ensure the program could run successfully.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**  
This project helped me realize how important it is to plan for file handling, data management, and user input ahead of time. Small setup details can cause bigger problems later.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
I started paying more attention to how I organize code, break functionality into smaller parts (like using a class for the Binary Search Tree), and use clear error handling for unexpected issues.
